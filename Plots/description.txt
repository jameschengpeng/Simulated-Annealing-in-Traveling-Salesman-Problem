Since in the textbook, neighbors are defined by "reverse". We regard the result got by "reverse" and "t1" as the global minimum

In order to do comparation, for each certain number of vertices, we store the graph. No matter what kind of neighboring definition, we apply the algorithms to the same graph

"reverse"
t3 performs worst, don't care about that
finally, t2 and t1 cost approximately same time to converge. HOWEVER, t2 converges faster at first!

IDEA: use t2 first, then t1. The changing point is a hyper-parameter
